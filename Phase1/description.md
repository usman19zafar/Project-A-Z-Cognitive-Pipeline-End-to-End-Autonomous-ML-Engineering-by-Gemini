KPI Target,Automated Outlier Handling & Non-Linear Feature Generation

1. Advanced Data Wrangling (Outlier & Skew Logic)
Standard repos fail when a dataset has "extreme" values (like the outliers in the Udemy "Salaries" CSV). We will implement Winsorization (clipping extreme values) and Power Transforms.

2. Feature Engineering (The Non-Linear Edge)
To beat other AIs, we will auto-generate Polynomial Features. This allows simple Linear Regression to act like a complex curve-fitter without you manually typing the equations.
