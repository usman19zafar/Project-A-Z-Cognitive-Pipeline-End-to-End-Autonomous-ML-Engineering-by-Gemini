👑 KING MODEL OS · Cp EditionA Mathematical Constitution for Data Governance

📖 Phase 1: The Inheritance (Starting Point)The system began as a modular Python framework designed for automated machine learning.Engine: The "Strict 19" (10 Classification models / 9 Regression models).Infrastructure: Five core scripts (app.py, ingestion.py, diagnostics.py, preprocessing.py, tournament.py).Logic: A "Brute Force" tournament where data was cleaned and immediately thrown into 19 models to find a champion based on F1-Score or RMSE.

🏛️ Phase 2: The Council of 100We identified a dormant asset: library_registry.py.The Problem: 100 "Mathematical Contracts" existed in the code but weren't being used.The Pivot: We decided to shift from "blind modeling" to "Informed Selection." The library was redefined as a set of rules that data must satisfy before a model is even considered.

🚔 Phase 3: The Institutional RealignmentInspired by the way human systems (schools, hospitals, prisons) classify individuals to manage risk and resources, we reimagined the OS as a Data Institution. The "No Rejection" Policy: Every dataset—no matter how messy or "criminal"—must be governed. Rejection is a failure of the facility.The Safety Net: The "Black Hole" facility was designed to catch the most chaotic data using high-restraint ensembles (Tree-based models).

⚖️ Phase 4: The Mathematical ConstitutionWe integrated two high-level academic authorities to govern the "Intake Exam":Gerald van Belle’s Statistical Rules of Thumb: Used to set the hard numeric boundaries (e.g., $n > 30$, Skewness $\pm 1$, VIF thresholds).Das & Bhattacharjee’s 101 Graphical Techniques: Used for visual heuristics to verify the "shape" of the data through diagnostics like ACF plots and Residual mapping.

🧬 Phase 5: The Intake & Purification Logic (Current Stand)We have finalized the Intake Officer’s Logic Map. The data now follows a strict hierarchy of "Crimes" (Pathologies):Sample Adequacy: Checking if the "inmate" is a Juvenile ($n$ too small) or requires Isolation ($p > n$).Temporal Dependence: Checking for "communication" between data points (Autocorrelation).
Purification Rituals: Applying MICE Imputation (Social preservation) and Yeo-Johnson Shaping (Forceful symmetry).Final Facility Assignment: Categorizing the purified data into one of the  7 Facilities:General Population (Parametric)High-Security Ward (Robust)The Isolation Cell (Sparse)The Psychiatric Ward (Non-Linear)The Observation Room (Time-Series) The Juvenile Wing (Bayesian)The Black Hole (Chaos/Ensemble)
