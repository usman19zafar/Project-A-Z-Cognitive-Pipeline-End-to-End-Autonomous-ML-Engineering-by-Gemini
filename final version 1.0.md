# 👑 King Model OS: Agentic Decision Science Engine

A high-performance, automated Machine Learning pipeline built for rapid data diagnostics and strategic "What-If" simulations. 

## 🚀 The Journey: From Chaos to Precision
The development of King Model OS was an iterative battle against computational bottlenecks. 
- **The Challenge:** Handling 4,750+ rows of messy data without locking the UI thread.
- **The Pivot:** After facing significant "thread-locks" and "Zero-Impact" simulation bugs, we moved from a linear script to a **Decoupled Architecture**.
- **The Breakthrough:** Implementing **Precision Calibration** (Probability-based shifts) and **Lazy Loading** for UI elements, allowing for real-time causal exploration.

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Semantic Pruning:** Automated exclusion logic based on custom policy keywords.
- **Professional Wrangler:** Integrated Iterative Imputation and Isolation Forest for outlier-free training.
- **Strategic Multiverse:** A simulation dashboard that tracks "Causal Levers" with 6-decimal precision.
- **Cyberpunk UI:** A custom CSS-injected Streamlit interface for high-density data viewing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Custom CSS/HTML).
- **Architecture:** Class-based Agentic Logic.
