The 10x Master Steps & Technical KPIs

# Phase 1: The Autonomous Core (The Reliability Layer)

## Step 1.1: System Boilerplate: Strict directory isolation, pyproject.toml, and logging hierarchy.KPI: 100% path resolution and zero dependency conflicts.
## Step 1.2: The AutonomousPreprocessor: A class that handles Part 1 of the course. It must detect categorical/numerical data, apply iterative imprinting, and scale features based on distribution checks.KPI: 0% Data Leakage (Fit on Train, Transform on Test).
## Step 1.3: Unified Config Layer: Implementing pipeline_config.yaml to decouple code from data.KPI: Ability to swap datasets (e.g., from Data.csv to Position_Salaries.csv) without changing a line of Python.

# Phase 2: The Tournament Arena (The Supervised Layer)

## Step 2.1: Regression Arena: Parallel training of various regression models with automated $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$ leaderboards.
## Step 2.2: Classification Arena: Automated testing of 7 classification models with integrated Heatmap Confusion Matrices.
## Step 2.3: Explainability Engine: Integrating SHAP or Feature Importance to "open the black box" of the winning model.KPI: Automated "Winner Selection" based on a weighted score of Accuracy and Inference Latency.

# Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (The Optimization Layer)
## Step 3.1: Clustering & Association: Auto-tuning for $K$ via the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
## Step 3.2: Reinforcement Learning Dashboard: Side-by-side comparison of UCB vs. Thompson Sampling.
## Step 3.3: Neural Architecture: Production-grade TensorFlow ANN/CNN with Early Stopping and Validation monitors.KPI: 100% convergence stability on course datasets.

# Phase 4: MLOps & Production (The "Winning" Edge)
## Step 4.1: Model Persistence: Versioned Model Registry using joblib with metadata logging.
## Step 4.2: FastAPI Serving: Turning the winning model into a live endpoint with Pydantic validation.
## Step 4.3: Whitepaper README: The technical comparison proving highest grade in code quality (Ruff/Flake8).
